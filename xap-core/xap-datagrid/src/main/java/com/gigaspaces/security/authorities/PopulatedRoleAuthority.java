/**
 * A role authority which holds all the authorities this role represents. <p> Commonly, a users'
 * details are stored in one table 'users-table' and its roles are stored in another 'role-table'.
 * The users' authorities of type {@link RoleAuthority} are actually keys (by role-name) to the role
 * details. <p> When authenticating a user, an {@link Authentication} object is returned with all
 * the users' details and authorities. To be ignorant of how details are actually kept, the users'
 * details are populated with a flat representation of all the authorities a role represents. <p>
 * The first option to populate a users' authorities with a role is to just add the authorities a
 * role represents. But, you loose the 'role' representation. If you want to keep it, for example
 * for visibility in tooling, you can return a {@link PopulatedRoleAuthority}. Thus, {@link
 * UserDetails#getAuthorities()} will include user-specific authorities and {@link
 * PopulatedRoleAuthority}. <p> This is only relevant is you are planning to implement your own
 * {@link SecurityManager}. Out default implementation already incorporates this construct.
